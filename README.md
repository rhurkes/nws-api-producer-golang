# Implemented Products - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Area_Message_Encoding
- `LSR` Local Storm Report. Only grabs the last 30 minutes on a fresh start as there can be 1000+ on the product list response.
- `SWO` Severe Storm Outlook Narrative. Includes the 1/2/3/4-8 day outlooks (ACUS01/02/03/48) and Mesoscale Discussions (ACUS11).
        MDs contain their own coordinates and do not have a corresponding PTS.
- `SEL` Severe Local Storm Watch and Watch Cancellation Msg. Issued when watches are issued. Has the watch text.
- `TOR` Tornado Warning. Can contain Tornado Emergency status (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_emergency)

- `AFD` Area Forecast Discussion.

# TODO
- What has the watch coords?
- implement flood things
- implement isPDS for all warnings
- Finish testing main/kafka/api stuff 
- Logging
- Mocking
1. Figure out project structure
2. Figure out structs vs classes: https://medium.com/@simplyianm/why-gos-structs-are-superior-to-class-based-inheritance-b661ba897c67
3. Kafka errors on verbose testing
