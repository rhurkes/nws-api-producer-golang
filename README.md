# Implemented Products - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Area_Message_Encoding
- `LSR` DONE Local Storm Report. Only grabs the last 30 minutes on a fresh start as there can be 1000+ on the product list response.
- `SWO` DONE Severe Storm Outlook Narrative. Includes the 1/2/3/4-8 day outlooks (ACUS01/02/03/48) and Mesoscale Discussions (ACUS11).
        MDs contain their own coordinates and do not have a corresponding PTS. I think I only care about the SWODY1 for MVP.
- `SEL` DONE Severe Local Storm Watch and Watch Cancellation Msg. Issued when watches are issued. Has the watch text.
- `TOR` DONE Tornado Warning. Can contain Tornado Emergency status (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_emergency)
- `SVR` Severe Thunderstorm Warning.
- `SVS` DONE Severe Weather Statement. Can contain Tornado Emergency status (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_emergency)
- `AFD` DONE Area Forecast Discussion.

# Notes
Any watch or warning can have PDS terminology

# Potential Products
- `WOU` Watch Outline Update. Has the counties listed out for each watch.
- `WCN` Weather Watch Clearance Notification. Shows issued watches, but several minutes later. Generated by WFOs. Don't use this for anything.
- `SPS` Special Weather Statement. Why would I want this?
- `FFA` Flash Flood Watch
- `FLA` Flood Watch
- `FFW` Flash Flood Warning
- `FLW` Flood Warning

# Only Playable when/if mapping is added
- `PTS` Probabilistic Outlook Points. Contains coordinates for SWO outlooks (WUUS01/02/03/48).
- `SEV` Shows coordinates for all active watches.

# TODO
IMMEDIATE:
2. implement SEL
4. SVR
5. redo and standardize all product schemas
6. watch probabilities

2. Figure out structs vs classes: https://medium.com/@simplyianm/why-gos-structs-are-superior-to-class-based-inheritance-b661ba897c67
3. Kafka errors on verbose testing

4. changing retention time doesn't seem to purge topic
6. Logging
7. Mocking

1. Break out LSR mag into value and units and measured/estimated
