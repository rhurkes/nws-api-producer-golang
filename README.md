# Necessary Products
- `LSR` DONE Local Storm Report. Only grabs the last 30 minutes on a fresh start as there can be 1000+ on the product list response.
- `SWO` DONE Severe Storm Outlook Narrative. Includes the 1/2/3/4-8 day outlooks (ACUS01/02/03/48) and Mesoscale Discussions (ACUS11).
        MDs contain their own coordinates and do not have a corresponding PTS. I think I only care about the SWODY1 for MVP.
